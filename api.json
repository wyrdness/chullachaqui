      "full": "Chullachaqui is a forest spirit from Peruvian Amazon indigenous folklore, particularly among the Shipibo-Conibo and other Amazonian groups. Described as a dwarf standing 3-4 feet tall, the Chullachaqui's defining characteristic is one deformed foot—often described as larger than the other, twisted, or resembling a pig or deer hoof. The spirit shapeshifts to appear as a friend, family member, or familiar person, luring unsuspecting victims deep into the forest. Once the person is hopelessly lost, the Chullachaqui abandons them, often leading them in circles. The spirit serves as a forest protector, punishing those who harm nature or take too much from the forest. Detection is possible by checking the feet, as one is always visibly deformed. Hunters and forest travelers ask permission, leave offerings, and show respect to the forest to avoid encounters. The Chullachaqui is similar to the Brazilian Curupira, which also has backward feet and serves as a forest guardian."
